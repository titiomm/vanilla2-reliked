# Vanilla 2 ReLiked 

ReLiked is a simple Vanilla2 Forums plugin to add the Facebook like button, with all options customizable, to your discussions.

You do not need to create a facebook app & can disable the facebook script insertion in the settings in case it is redundant with other plugins.

## Install

To install just create a ReLiked folder in your plugin directory and put all files there.

## TODO

v1.1: More position & customization by position
